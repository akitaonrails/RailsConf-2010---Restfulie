== Restfulie App Store Demo

Restfulie Demo using a sample scaffold app called "App Store". The idea being that there will be many apps registered that need to be evaluated and then approved or declined. Check out the 'app/model/app.rb' for the state machine.

== Setup

This app was tested with Ruby EE 1.8.7, Rails 2.3.8, Restfulie 0.8.1. Run 'rake reset' to create the database and the initial set of apps.

== Running

Run the Mechanize version:

   ruby client/mechanize.rb

Run the Active Resource version (you have to comment out the Restfulie include in the AppsController):

   ruby client/active_resource.rb

Run the basic Restfulie client version:

   ruby client/restfulie_client.rb

Run the Mikyung client:

   ruby client/mikyung.rb

== Disclaimer

This is a very simple app designed to show case the many ways of interoperating with a Rails
app. This is not a complete app, nor a complex workflow. The purpose is to serve as a simple
demonstration app for RailsConf 2010.
